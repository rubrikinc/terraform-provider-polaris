The `polaris_aws_cnp_permissions` data source is used to access information
about the permissions required by RSC for a specified feature set.

## Permission Groups
Following is a list of features and their applicable permission groups. These
are used when specifying the feature set.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_S3_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`EXOCOMPUTE`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.
  * `RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER` - Represents the set of permissions required for the
    Rubrik-managed Exocompute cluster.

`RDS_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`SERVERS_AND_APPS`
  * `CLOUD_CLUSTER_ES` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

-> **Note:** When permission groups are specified, the `BASIC` permission group
   is always required except for the `SERVERS_AND_APPS` feature.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts" "artifacts" {
  feature {
    name = "CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION"
    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
    ]
  }

  feature {
    name = "EXOCOMPUTE"
    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
      "RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER",
    ]
  }
}

# Lookup the required permissions using the output from the
# polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts data source.
data "polaris_aws_cnp_permissions" "permissions" {
  for_each = data.polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts.artifacts.role_keys
  cloud    = data.polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts.artifacts.cloud
  role_key = each.key

  dynamic "feature" {
    for_each = data.polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts.artifacts.feature
    content {
      name              = feature.value["name"]
      permission_groups = feature.value["permission_groups"]
    }
  }
}
```


## Schema

### Required

- `feature` (Block Set, Min: 1) RSC feature with optional permission groups. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--feature))

### Optional

- `cloud` (String) AWS cloud type. Possible values are `STANDARD`, `CHINA` and `GOV`. Default value is `STANDARD`.
- `ec2_recovery_role_path` (String) AWS EC2 recovery role path.

### Read-Only

- `customer_managed_policies` (List of Object) Customer managed policies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--customer_managed_policies))

### Nested Schema for `feature`

Required:

- `name` (String) RSC feature name. Possible values are `CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`, `CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`, `CLOUD_NATIVE_S3_PROTECTION`, `SERVERS_AND_APPS`, `EXOCOMPUTE` and `RDS_PROTECTION`.
- `permission_groups` (Set of String) RSC permission groups for the feature. Possible values are `BASIC`, `CLOUD_CLUSTER_ES` and `RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER`. For backwards compatibility, [] is interpreted as all applicable permission groups
