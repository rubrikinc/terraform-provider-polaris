# polaris_user (Data Source)

The `polaris_user` data source is used to access information about an RSC user.
Information for both local and SSO users can be accessed. A user is looked up
using either the ID or the email address.

Note, `status` will always be `UNKNOWN` for SSO users.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Look up user by email address.
data "polaris_user" "admin" {
  email = "admin@example.org"
}

# Look up user by user ID.
data "polaris_user" "admin" {
  user_id = "auth0|700265c9583ef80078bb36b0"
}

# Look up SSO user by user ID.
data "polaris_user" "admin" {
  user_id = "samlp|...my-rubrik-account|admin@example.org"
}
```
