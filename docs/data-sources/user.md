# polaris_user (Data Source)

The `polaris_user` data source is used to access information about an RSC user.
Information for both local and SSO users can be accessed. A user is looked up
using either the ID or the email address.

-> **Note:** RSC allows the same email address to be used, at the same time, by
   both local and SSO users. Use the `domain` field to specify in which domain
   to look for a user.

-> **Note:** The `status` field will always be `UNKNOWN` for SSO users.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Look up user by email address.
data "polaris_user" "admin" {
  email = "admin@example.org"
}

# Look up user by email address and user domain.
data "polaris_user" "admin" {
  email  = "admin@example.org"
  domain = "SSO"
}

# Look up user by user ID.
data "polaris_user" "admin" {
  user_id = "<id>"
}
```
