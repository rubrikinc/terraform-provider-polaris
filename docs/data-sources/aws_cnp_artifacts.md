# polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts (Data Source)

The `polaris_aws_archival_location` data source is used to access information
about instance profiles and roles required by RSC for a specified feature set.

## Permission Groups
Following is a list of features and their applicable permission groups. These
are used when specifying the feature set.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_S3_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`EXOCOMPUTE`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.
  * `RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER` - Represents the set of permissions required for the
    Rubrik-managed Exocompute cluster.

`RDS_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

-> **Note:** When permission groups are specified, the `BASIC` permission group
   must always be included.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Single feature with permission groups.
data "polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts" "artifacts" {
  feature {
    name = "CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION"
    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
    ]
  }
}

# Single feature with multiple permission groups. When multiple permission
# groups are specified, the BASIC permission group must always be included.
data "polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts" "artifacts" {
  feature {
    name = "EXOCOMPUTE"
    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
      "RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER",
    ]
  }
}

# Multiple features with permission groups.
data "polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts" "artifacts" {
  feature {
    name = "CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION"
    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
    ]
  }

  feature {
    name = "EXOCOMPUTE"
    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
      "RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER",
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `feature` (Block Set, Min: 1) RSC feature with permission groups. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--feature))

### Optional

- `cloud` (String) AWS cloud type. Possible values are `STANDARD`, `CHINA` and `GOV`. Default value is `STANDARD`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) SHA-256 hash of the instance profile keys and the roleskeys.
- `instance_profile_keys` (Set of String) Instance profile keys for the RSC features.
- `role_keys` (Set of String) Role keys for the RSC features.

### Nested Schema for `feature`

Required:

- `name` (String) RSC feature name. Possible values are `CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`, `CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`, `CLOUD_NATIVE_S3_PROTECTION`, `EXOCOMPUTE` and `RDS_PROTECTION`.
- `permission_groups` (Set of String) RSC permission groups for the feature. Possible values are `BASIC` and `RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER`. For backwards compatibility, `[]` is interpreted as all applicable permission groups.
