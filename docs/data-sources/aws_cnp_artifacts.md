# polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts (Data Source)

The `polaris_aws_archival_location` data source is used to access information about
instance profiles and roles required by RSC for a specified feature set.

## Permission Groups
Following is a list of features and their applicable permission groups. These are used
when specifying the feature set.

### CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the feature.

### CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL_ENCRYPTION
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the feature.
  * `ENCRYPTION` - Represents the set of permissions required for encryption operations.

### CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the feature.
  * `EXPORT_AND_RESTORE` - Represents the set of permissions required for export and
    restore operations.
  * `FILE_LEVEL_RECOVERY` - Represents the set of permissions required for file-level
    recovery operations.
  * `SNAPSHOT_PRIVATE_ACCESS` - Represents the set of permissions required for private
    access to disk snapshots.

### CLOUD_NATIVE_S3_PROTECTION
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the feature.

### EXOCOMPUTE\n" +
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the feature.
  * `PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS` - Represents the set of permissions required for usage of private
    endpoints.
  * `RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER` - Represents the set of permissions required for the Rubrik-
    managed Exocompute cluster.

### RDS_PROTECTION
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the feature.

-> **Note:** When permission groups are specified, the `BASIC` permission group must
   always be included.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Permission groups defaults to BASIC.
data "polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts" "artifacts" {
  feature {
    name = "CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION"
  }
}

# Multiple permission groups. When permission groups are specified,
# the BASIC permission group must always be included.
data "polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts" "artifacts" {
  feature {
    name = "CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION"

    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
      "EXPORT_AND_RESTORE",
      "EXPORT_AND_RESTORE",
    ]
  }
}

# Multiple features with permission groups.
data "polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts" "artifacts" {
  feature {
    name = "CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL"

    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
    ]
  }

  feature {
    name = "CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL_ENCRYPTION"

    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
      "ENCRYPTION",
    ]
  }

  feature {
    name = "CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION"

    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
    ]
  }
}
```
