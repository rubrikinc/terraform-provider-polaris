  The polaris_gcp_permissions data source is used to access information about
  the permissions required by RSC for an RSC feature.
  The polaris_gcp_permissions data source can be used with the
  google_project_iam_custom_role resource and the permissions field of the
  polaris_gcp_project resource to automatically update the permissions of roles
  and notify RSC about the updated.
  Permission Groups
  Following is a list of features and their applicable permission groups. These
  are used when specifying the feature.
  CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL
  BASIC - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
  feature.ENCRYPTION - Represents the set of permissions required for encryption
  operation.
  CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION
  BASIC - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
  feature.EXPORT_AND_RESTORE - Represents the set of permissions required for export
  and restore operations.FILE_LEVEL_RECOVERY - Represents the set of permissions required for
  file-level recovery operations.
  GCP_SHARED_VPC_HOST
  BASIC - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
  feature.
  EXOCOMPUTE
  BASIC - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
  feature.
  -> Note: When permission groups are specified, the BASIC permission group
  is always required .
  -> Note: Due to backward compatibility, the features field allow the
  feature names to be given in 3 different styles: EXAMPLE_FEATURE_NAME,
  example-feature-name or example_feature_name. The recommended style is
  EXAMPLE_FEATURE_NAME as it is what the RSC API itself uses.

# polaris_gcp_permissions (Data Source)

The `polaris_gcp_permissions` data source is used to access information about
the permissions required by RSC for an RSC feature.

The `polaris_gcp_permissions` data source can be used with the
`google_project_iam_custom_role` resource and the `permissions` field of the
`polaris_gcp_project` resource to automatically update the permissions of roles
and notify RSC about the updated.

## Permission Groups
Following is a list of features and their applicable permission groups. These
are used when specifying the feature.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.
  * `ENCRYPTION` - Represents the set of permissions required for encryption
    operation.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.
  * `EXPORT_AND_RESTORE` - Represents the set of permissions required for export
    and restore operations.
  * `FILE_LEVEL_RECOVERY` - Represents the set of permissions required for
    file-level recovery operations.

`GCP_SHARED_VPC_HOST`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`EXOCOMPUTE`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

-> **Note:** When permission groups are specified, the `BASIC` permission group
   is always required .

-> **Note:** Due to backward compatibility, the `features` field allow the
   feature names to be given in 3 different styles: `EXAMPLE_FEATURE_NAME`,
   `example-feature-name` or `example_feature_name`. The recommended style is
   `EXAMPLE_FEATURE_NAME` as it is what the RSC API itself uses.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "polaris_gcp_permissions" "cloud_native_archival" {
  feature = "CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL"
  permission_groups = [
    "BASIC",
    "ENCRYPTION",
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `feature` (String) RSC feature. Note that the feature must be given in the `EXAMPLE_FEATURE_NAME` style. Possible values are `CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`, `CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`, `GCP_SHARED_VPC_HOST` and `EXOCOMPUTE`.
- `features` (Set of String, Deprecated) RSC features. Possible values are `CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`, `CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`, `GCP_SHARED_VPC_HOST` and `EXOCOMPUTE`. **Deprecated:** use `feature` instead.
- `permission_groups` (Set of String) Permission groups for the RSC feature. Possible values are `BASIC`, `ENCRYPTION`, `EXPORT_AND_RESTORE` and `FILE_LEVEL_RECOVERY`.

### Read-Only

- `conditions` (Set of String) Conditions for the permissions with conditions.
- `hash` (String, Deprecated) SHA-256 hash of the permissions, can be used to detect changes to the permissions. **Deprecated:** use `id` instead.
- `id` (String) SHA-256 hash of the required permissions, will be updated as the required permissions changes.
- `permissions` (List of String, Deprecated) Permissions required for the set of RSC features. Includes permissions with conditions. **Deprecated:** use `with_conditions` and `without_conditions` instead.
- `services` (Set of String) GCP services required for the RSC feature.
- `with_conditions` (Set of String) Permissions with conditions required for the RSC feature.
- `without_conditions` (Set of String) Permissions without conditions required for the RSC feature.
