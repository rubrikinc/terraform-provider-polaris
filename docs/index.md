# Polaris Provider
The Polaris provider provides resources to interact with the Rubrik Polaris platform. Additional examples on how to use the provider are available in the [terraform-provider-polaris-examples](https://github.com/rubrikinc/terraform-provider-polaris-examples) GitHub repository.

~> Upgrading from v0.2.0 to v0.3.0 requires that the definition of certain resources are updated on disk. Please see the upgrade guide for more information.

## Configuration
The provider supports both local user accounts and service accounts. For documentation on how to create either using Polaris see the [Rubrik Support Portal](http://support.rubrik.com).

### With Local User Account
First create a directory called `.rubrik` in your home directory. Next, create a file called `polaris-accounts.json` in that directory. This JSON file holds one or more local user accounts:
```json
{
  "<my-account>": {
    "username": "<my-username>",
    "password": "<my-password>",
    "url": "<my-polaris-url>"
  }
}
```
Where *my-account* is an arbitrary name used to refer to the account when configuring the provider. *my-username* and *my-password* are the username and password of the local user account. *my-polaris-url* is the URL of the Polaris API. The URL follows the pattern `https://{polaris-domain}.my.rubrik.com/api`. Which is the same URL as for accessing the Polaris UI but with `/api` added to the end.

To configure the provider to use a local user account specify the name as the provider credentials:
```terraform
provider "polaris" {
  credentials = "my-account"
}
```

### With Service Account
First download the service account credentials as a JSON file from the Polaris User Management UI page. Next, configure the provider to use the downloaded credentials file in the Terraform configuration:
```terraform
provider "polaris" {
  credentials = "/path/to/service-account-credentials.json"
}
```

### Environment Variables
The following environmental variables can be used to override the default behavior of the provider:
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_LOGLEVEL` - Overrides the log level of the provider. Valid log levels are: `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE` and `OFF`. The default log level of the provider is `WARN`.

When using a local user account the following environmental variables can be used to override the default local user account behavior:
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_ACCOUNT_FILE` - Overrides the name and path of the file to read local user accounts from.
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_ACCOUNT_NAME` - Overrides the name of the local user account given to the credentials parameter in the provider configuration.
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_ACCOUNT_USERNAME` - Overrides the username of the local user account.
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD` - Overrides the password of the local user account.
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_ACCOUNT_URL` - Overrides the Polaris API URL.

When using a service account the following environmental variables can be used to override the default service account behavior:
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_SERVICEACCOUNT_FILE` - Overrides the name and path of the service account credentials file.
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_SERVICEACCOUNT_NAME` - Overrides the name of the service account.
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_SERVICEACCOUNT_CLIENTID` - Overrides the client id of the service account.
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_SERVICEACCOUNT_CLIENTSECRET` - Overrides the client secret of the service account.
* `RUBRIK_POLARIS_SERVICEACCOUNT_ACCESSTOKENURI` - Overrides the service account access token URI. When using a service account the Polaris API URL is derived from this URI.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# With local user account
provider "polaris" {
  credentials = "my-account"
}

# With service account
provider "polaris" {
  credentials = "/path/to/service-account-credentials.json"
}
```
