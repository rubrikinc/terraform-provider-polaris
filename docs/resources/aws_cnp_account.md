# polaris_aws_cnp_account (Resource)

The `polaris_aws_cnp_account` resource adds an AWS account to RSC using the
non-CFT (Cloud Formation Template) workflow. The `polaris_aws_account` resource
can be used to add an AWS account to RSC using the CFT workflow.

## Permission Groups
Following is a list of features and their applicable permission groups. These
are used when specifying the feature set.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_S3_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`EXOCOMPUTE`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the

-> **Note:** When permission groups are specified, the `BASIC` permission group
   must always be included.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Using hardcoded values.
resource "polaris_aws_cnp_account" "account" {
  name      = "My Account"
  native_id = "123456789123"

  regions = [
    "us-east-2",
    "us-west-2",
  ]

  feature {
    name = "CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION"
    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
    ]
  }

  feature {
    name = "EXOCOMPUTE"
    permission_groups = [
      "BASIC",
      "RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER",
    ]
  }
}

# Using variables for the account values and the features. The dynamic
# feature block could also be expanded from the polaris_aws_cnp_artifacts
# data source.
variable "name" {
  type        = string
  description = "AWS account name."
}

variable "native_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "AWS account ID."
}

variable "regions" {
  type        = set(string)
  description = "AWS regions to protect."
}

variable "features" {
  type = map(object({
    permission_groups = set(string)
  }))
  description = "RSC features with permission groups."
}

resource "polaris_aws_cnp_account" "account" {
  name      = var.name
  native_id = var.native_id
  regions   = var.regions

  dynamic "feature" {
    for_each = var.features
    content {
      name              = feature.key
      permission_groups = feature.value["permission_groups"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `feature` (Block Set, Min: 1) RSC feature with permission groups. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--feature))
- `native_id` (String) AWS account ID. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `regions` (Set of String) Regions.

### Optional

- `cloud` (String) AWS cloud type. Possible values are `STANDARD`, `CHINA` and `GOV`. Default value is `STANDARD`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `delete_snapshots_on_destroy` (Boolean) Should snapshots be deleted when the resource is destroyed.
- `external_id` (String) External ID. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `name` (String) Account name.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) RSC cloud account ID (UUID).

<a id="nestedblock--feature"></a>
### Nested Schema for `feature`

Required:

- `name` (String) RSC feature name. Possible values are `CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`, `CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`, `CLOUD_NATIVE_S3_PROTECTION`, `SERVER_AND_APPS`, `EXOCOMPUTE` and `RDS_PROTECTION`.
- `permission_groups` (Set of String) RSC permission groups for the feature. Possible values are `BASIC` and `RSC_MANAGED_CLUSTER`. For backwards compatibility, `[]` is interpreted as all applicable permission groups.
