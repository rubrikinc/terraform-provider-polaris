# polaris_aws_cloud_cluster (Resource)

The `polaris_aws_cloud_cluster` resource creates an AWS cloud cluster using RSC.

This resource creates a Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM) cluster with elastic storage 
in AWS using the specified configuration. The cluster will be deployed with the specified
number of nodes, instance types, and network configuration.

~> **Note:** This resource creates actual AWS infrastructure. Destroying the
   resource will attempt to clean up the created resources, but manual cleanup
   may be required.

~> **Note:** The AWS account must be onboarded to RSC with the Server and Apps
   feature enabled before creating a cloud cluster.

~> **Note:** Cloud Cluster Removal is not supported via terraform yet. The cluster
   will be removed from state and you must remove the cluster through the RSC UI.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an AWS cloud cluster using RSC
resource "polaris_aws_cloud_cluster" "example" {
  cloud_account_id     = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  region               = "us-west-2"
  use_placement_groups = true

  cluster_config {
    cluster_name            = "my-cloud-cluster"
    admin_email             = "admin@example.com"
    admin_password          = "RubrikGoForward!"
    dns_name_servers        = ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
    dns_search_domains      = ["example.com"]
    ntp_servers             = ["pool.ntp.org"]
    num_nodes               = 3
    bucket_name             = "my-s3-bucket"
    enable_immutability     = true
    keep_cluster_on_failure = false

    vm_config {
      cdm_version           = "9.4.0-p2-30507"
      instance_type         = "M6I_2XLARGE"
      instance_profile_name = "RubrikCloudClusterInstanceProfile"

## Schema

### Required

- `cloud_account_id` (String) RSC cloud account ID (UUID).
- `cluster_config` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Configuration for the cloud cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cluster_config))
- `region` (String) AWS region to deploy the cluster in. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `vm_config` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) VM configuration for the cluster nodes. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--vm_config))

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `use_placement_groups` (Boolean) Whether to use placement groups for the cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Cloud cluster ID (UUID).

### Nested Schema for `cluster_config`

Required:

- `admin_email` (String) Email address for the cluster admin user. Changing this value will have no effect on the cluster.
- `admin_password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the cluster admin user. Changing this value will have no effect on the cluster.
- `bucket_name` (String) Name of the S3 bucket to use for the cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `cluster_name` (String) Unique name to assign to the cloud cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `dns_name_servers` (Set of String) DNS name servers for the cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `enable_immutability` (Boolean) Whether to enable immutability and object lock for the S3 bucket. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `keep_cluster_on_failure` (Boolean) Whether to keep the cluster on failure (can be useful for troubleshooting). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `ntp_servers` (Set of String) NTP servers for the cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `num_nodes` (Number) Number of nodes in the cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

Optional:

- `dns_search_domains` (Set of String) DNS search domains for the cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.


<a id="nestedblock--vm_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `vm_config`

Required:

- `cdm_version` (String) CDM version to use. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `instance_profile_name` (String) AWS instance profile name for the cluster nodes. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `instance_type` (String) AWS instance type for the cluster nodes. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Supported values are `M5_4XLARGE`, `M6I_2XLARGE`, `M6I_4XLARGE`, `M6I_8XLARGE`, `R6I_4XLARGE`, `M6A_2XLARGE`, `M6A_4XLARGE`, `M6A_8XLARGE` and `R6A_4XLARGE`.
- `security_group_ids` (Set of String) AWS security group IDs for the cluster nodes. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
