# polaris_azure_service_principal (Resource)

The `polaris_azure_service_principal` resource adds an Azure service principal to RSC. A service principal must be added for each Azure tenant before subscriptions for the tenants can be added to RSC.

There are 3 ways to create a `polaris_azure_service principal` resource:
  1. Using the `app_id`, `app_name`, `app_secret`, `tenant_id` and `tenant_domain` fields.
  2. Using the `credentials` field which is the path to a custom service principal file. A description      of the custom format can be found      [here](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-polaris-sdk-for-go?tab=readme-ov-file#azure-credentials).
  3. Using the `sdk_auth` field which is the path to an Azure service principal created with the Azure      SDK using the `--sdk-auth` parameter.

The `permissions` field can be used with the `polaris_azure_permissions` data source to inform RSC about permission updates when the Terraform configuration is applied.

~> **Note:** Removing the last subscription from an RSC tenant will automatically remove the tenant, which also removes the service principal.

~> **Note:** Destroying the `polaris_azure_service_principal` resource only updates the local state, it does not remove the service principal from RSC. However, creating another `polaris_azure_service_principal` resource for the same Azure tenant will overwrite the old service principal in RSC.

-> **Note:** There is no way to verify if a service principal has been added to RSC using the UI. RSC tenants doesn't show up in the UI until the first subscription is added.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# With custom service principal file.
resource "polaris_azure_service_principal" "default" {
  credentials   = "${path.module}/service-principal.json"
  tenant_domain = "mydomain.onmicrosoft.com"
}

# With a service principal created using the Azure SDK and the
# --sdk-auth parameter.
resource "polaris_azure_service_principal" "default" {
  sdk_auth      = "${path.module}/sdk-service-principal.json"
  tenant_domain = "mydomain.onmicrosoft.com"
}

# Without a service principal file.
resource "polaris_azure_service_principal" "default" {
  app_id        = "25c2b42a-c76b-11eb-9767-6ff6b5b7e72b"
  app_name      = "My App"
  app_secret    = "<my-apps-secret>"
  tenant_domain = "mydomain.onmicrosoft.com"
  tenant_id     = "2bfdaef8-c76b-11eb-8d3d-4706c14a88f0"
}

# Using the polaris_azure_permissions data source to inform RSC
# about permission updates.
data "polaris_azure_permissions" "cnp" {
  features = [
    "CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION",
  ]
}

resource "polaris_azure_service_principal" "default" {
  app_id        = "25c2b42a-c76b-11eb-9767-6ff6b5b7e72b"
  app_name      = "My App"
  app_secret    = "<my-app-secret>"
  tenant_domain = "mydomain.onmicrosoft.com"
  tenant_id     = "2bfdaef8-c76b-11eb-8d3d-4706c14a88f0"
  permissions   = data.polaris_azure_permissions.cnp.id
}
```
