# polaris_azure_service_principal (Resource)

The `polaris_azure_service_principal` resource adds an Azure service principal to RSC. A service principal must be added for each Azure tenant before subscriptions for the tenants can be added to RSC.

There are 3 ways to create a `polaris_azure_service principal` resource:
  1. Using the `app_id`, `app_name`, `app_secret`, `tenant_id` and `tenant_domain` fields.
  2. Using the `credentials` field which is the path to a custom service principal file. A description      of the custom format can be found      [here](https://github.com/rubrikinc/rubrik-polaris-sdk-for-go?tab=readme-ov-file#azure-credentials).
  3. Using the `sdk_auth` field which is the path to an Azure service principal created with the Azure      SDK using the `--sdk-auth` parameter.

~> **Note:** Removing the last subscription from an RSC tenant will automatically remove the tenant, which also removes the service principal.

~> **Note:** Destroying the `polaris_azure_service_principal` resource only updates the local state, it does not remove the service principal from RSC. However, creating another `polaris_azure_service_principal` resource for the same Azure tenant will overwrite the old service principal in RSC.

-> **Note:** There is no way to verify if a service principal has been added to RSC using the UI. RSC tenants don't show up in the UI until the first subscription is added.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# With custom service principal file.
resource "polaris_azure_service_principal" "default" {
  credentials   = "${path.module}/service-principal.json"
  tenant_domain = "mydomain.onmicrosoft.com"
}

# With a service principal created using the Azure SDK and the
# --sdk-auth parameter.
resource "polaris_azure_service_principal" "default" {
  sdk_auth      = "${path.module}/sdk-service-principal.json"
  tenant_domain = "mydomain.onmicrosoft.com"
}

# Without a service principal file.
resource "polaris_azure_service_principal" "default" {
  app_id        = "25c2b42a-c76b-11eb-9767-6ff6b5b7e72b"
  app_name      = "My App"
  app_secret    = "<my-apps-secret>"
  tenant_domain = "mydomain.onmicrosoft.com"
  tenant_id     = "2bfdaef8-c76b-11eb-8d3d-4706c14a88f0"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `tenant_domain` (String) Azure tenant primary domain. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Optional

- `app_id` (String) Azure app registration application ID. Also known as the client ID. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `app_name` (String) Azure app registration display name. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `app_secret` (String, Sensitive) Azure app registration client secret. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `credentials` (String) Path to a custom service principal file. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `permissions` (String, Deprecated) Permissions updated signal. When this field is updated, the provider will notify RSC that permissions has been updated. Use this field with the `polaris_azure_permissions` data source. **Deprecated:** use the `polaris_azure_subscription` resource's `permissions` fields instead.
- `permissions_hash` (String, Deprecated) Permissions updated signal. **Deprecated:** use `permissions` instead.
- `sdk_auth` (String) Path to an Azure service principal created with the Azure SDK using the `--sdk-auth` parameter. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `tenant_id` (String) Azure tenant ID. Also known as the directory ID. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Azure app registration application ID. Also known as the client ID. Note, this might change in the future, use the `app_id` field to reference the application ID in configurations.
