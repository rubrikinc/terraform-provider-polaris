# polaris_tag_rule (Resource)

The `polaris_tag_rule` resource manages RSC tag rules.

A tag is a key-value pair used to group cloud resources for a specific purpose.
This rule-based approach allows resource protection across multiple projects and
regions. A tag can be used to assign an SLA Domain to all resources belonging to
a specific application or department. When cloud resources are tagged
appropriately, they derive protection automatically when they are instantiated.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Match all AWS EC2 instances which has a tag called my-key in all RSC cloud
# accounts.
resource "polaris_tag_rule" "rule" {
  name           = "my-tag-rule"
  object_type    = "AWS_EC2_INSTANCE"
  tag_key        = "my-key"
  tag_all_values = true
}

# Match all Azure VMs which has a tag called my-key with the value my-value in
# the my-azure-subscription RSC cloud account.
data "polaris_azure_subscription" "subscription" {
  name = "my-azure-subscription"
}

resource "polaris_tag_rule" "rule" {
  name        = "my-tag-rule"
  object_type = "AZURE_VIRTUAL_MACHINE"
  tag_key     = "my-key"
  tag_value   = "my-value"

  cloud_account_ids = [
    data.polaris_azure_subscription.subscription.id,
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Tag rule name.
- `object_type` (String) Object type to which the tag rule will be applied. Possible values are `AWS_EBS_VOLUME`, `AWS_EC2_INSTANCE`, `AWS_RDS_INSTANCE`, `AWS_S3_BUCKET`, `AZURE_MANAGED_DISK`, `AZURE_SQL_DATABASE_DB`, `AZURE_SQL_DATABASE_SERVER`, `AZURE_SQL_MANAGED_INSTANCE_SERVER`, `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` and `AZURE_VIRTUAL_MACHINE`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `tag_key` (String) Tag key to match. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Optional

- `cloud_account_ids` (Set of String) The RSC cloud account IDs (UUID) to which the tag rule should be applied. If empty, the tag rule will be applied to all RSC cloud accounts.
- `tag_all_values` (Boolean) If true, all tag values are matched. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `tag_value` (String) Tag value to match. If the tag value is empty, it matches empty values. To match all tag values, use the `tag_all_values` field. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Tag rule ID (UUID).
