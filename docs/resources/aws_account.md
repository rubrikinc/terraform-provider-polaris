# polaris_aws_account (Resource)

The `polaris_aws_account` resource adds an AWS account to RSC. To grant RSC
permissions to perform certain operations on the account, a Cloud Formation stack
is created from a template provided by RSC.

There are two ways to specify the AWS account to onboard:
 1. Using the `profile` field. The AWS profile is used to create the Cloud
    Formation stack and lookup the AWS account ID.
 2. Using the `assume_role`field with, or without, the `profile` field. If the
    `profile` field is omitted, the default profile is used. The profile is used
    to assume the role. The assumed role is then used and create the Cloud
    Formation stack and lookup the account ID.

Any combination of different RSC features can be enabled for an account:
  1. `cloud_native_protection` - Provides protection for AWS EC2 instances and
     EBS volumes through the rules and policies of SLA Domains.
  2. `exocompute` - Provides snapshot indexing, file recovery and application
     protection of AWS objects.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Enable Cloud Native Protection in the us-east-2 region.
resource "polaris_aws_account" "account" {
  profile = "default"

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = polaris_aws_account.account
  id = "d0e44ae7-73cb-4434-861b-369f3c060cb5"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
% terraform import polaris_aws_account.account d0e44ae7-73cb-4434-861b-369f3c060cb5
```
