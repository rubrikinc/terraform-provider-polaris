  The polaris_sla_domain resource is used to manage RSC global SLA Domains. SLA
  Domain defines how you want to take snapshots of objects like virtual machines,
  databases, SaaS apps and cloud objects. An SLA Domain can define frequency,
  retention, archival and replication.
  -> Enabling Instant Archive can increase bandwidth usage and archival storage
  requirements.
  -> The hourly retention for snapshots of cloud-native workloads must be a
  multiple of 24.
  -> For workloads backed up on a Rubrik cluster, snapshots are scheduled using
  the time zone of that Rubrik cluster. For workloads backed up in the cloud,
  snapshots are scheduled using the UTC time zone.
  
  Frequency
  This defines when and how often snapshots are taken. This could be interval-based (days, hours, minutes) or calendar-based (a day of each month).
  Retention
  This defines how long the snapshot is kept on the Rubrik cluster.
  Archival
  Before You Start: To archive snapshots, make sure you’ve added archival locations.
  To avoid early deletion fees, retain snapshots in cool tier archival locations for at least 30 days.
  
  Object types
  Azure SQL Databases
  Archival is mandatory and the backups will be instantly archived. Frequency and Retention apply to archived snapshots of the Azure SQL database.
  Continuous backups for point-in-time recovery retentions is configured in azure_sql_database_config.
  Azure SQL Managed Instance
  Archival and Replication are not supported by Azure SQL Managed Instance.
  Log backup for Azure SQL MI is configured in azure_sql_managed_instance_config.
  Azure Blob Storage
  Archival and Replication are not supported by Azure Blob Storage.
  Backup location for scheduled snapshots is configured in azure_blob_config.
  AWS RDS
  Archival is only supported for PostgrSQL and Aurora PostgreSQL databases.
  Continuous backups for point-in-time recovery retention is configured in aws_rds_config. If you don't specify a continuous backup, AWS provides 1 day of continuous backup by default for Aurora databases, which you can change but you can’t disable.
  AWS S3
  Archival and Replication are not supported by AWS S3. SLA Domains protecting AWS S3 cannot protect other object types.
  Backup location(s) are configured in backup_location.
  AWS DynamoDB
  Replication is not supported by AWS DynamoDB.
  Primary Backup Encryption KMS Key and Continuous backups for point-in-time recovery are configured in aws_dynamodb_config. Continuous backups will be automatically enabled for your DynamoDB tables.
  Disabling continuous backups or changing the retention period in your AWS console may lead to higher storage and consumption costs. To avoid this, keep continuous backups enabled in your AWS console.

# polaris_sla_domain (Resource)

The `polaris_sla_domain` resource is used to manage RSC global SLA Domains. SLA
Domain defines how you want to take snapshots of objects like virtual machines,
databases, SaaS apps and cloud objects. An SLA Domain can define frequency,
retention, archival and replication.

-> Enabling Instant Archive can increase bandwidth usage and archival storage
   requirements.

-> The hourly retention for snapshots of cloud-native workloads must be a
   multiple of 24.

-> For workloads backed up on a Rubrik cluster, snapshots are scheduled using
   the time zone of that Rubrik cluster. For workloads backed up in the cloud,
   snapshots are scheduled using the UTC time zone.

### Frequency

This defines when and how often snapshots are taken. This could be interval-based (days, hours, minutes) or calendar-based (a day of each month).

### Retention

This defines how long the snapshot is kept on the Rubrik cluster.

### Archival
Before You Start: To archive snapshots, make sure you’ve added archival locations.

To avoid early deletion fees, retain snapshots in cool tier archival locations for at least 30 days.
