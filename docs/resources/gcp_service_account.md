# polaris_gcp_service_account (Resource)

The `polaris_gcp_service_account` resource adds the GCP service account to RSC
as the default service account. The default service account will be used by RSC
to authenticate to the GCP for projects added to RSC without a service account.

~> **Note:** Changing the name of the default service account can take a
   considerable time to propagate through the system. Use the `ignore_changes`
   field of the `lifecycle` block if it becomes an issue.

~> **Note:** Destroying the `polaris_gcp_service_account` resource only updates
   the local state, it does not remove the service account from RSC. However,
   it's possible to overwrite the RSC global service account with new service
   accounts.

-> **Note:** There is no way to verify if an default GCP service account has
   been added to RSC using the UI.
