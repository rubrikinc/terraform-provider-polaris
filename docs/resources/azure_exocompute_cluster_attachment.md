# polaris_azure_exocompute_cluster_attachment (Resource)

The `polaris_azure_exocompute_cluster_attachment` resource attaches an Azure AKS
cluster to a customer managed host Exocompute configuration, allowing RSC to use

The cluster name must be specified as `<resource-group>/<cluster-name>`, e.g.
`my-resource-group/my-cluster`.

## Example Usage

```terraform

  exocompute_id = polaris_azure_exocompute.host.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_name` (String) Azure AKS cluster name. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `exocompute_id` (String) RSC exocompute configuration ID (UUID). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Optional

- `token_refresh` (Number) To force a refresh of the authentication token, part of the connection command and manifest, increase the value of this field. The token is valid for 24 hours.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) RSC cluster ID (UUID).
- `manifest` (String) Kubernetes manifest which can be passed to `kubectl apply` to create a connection between the cluster and RSC. See `connection_command` for an alternative connection method.
