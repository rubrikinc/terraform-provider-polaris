# polaris_sla_domain_assignment (Resource)

The `polaris_sla_domain_assignment` resource is used to assign SLA domains to
objects.

When an object is removed from the `polaris_sla_domain_assignment` resource, it
will inherit the SLA Domain of its parent object. If there is no parent object
or the parent object doesn't have an SLA Domain, the object will be unprotected.
Existing snapshots of the object will be retained according to the SLA Domain
inherited from the parent object. If the parent object doesn't have an SLA
Domain, the existing snapshots will be retained forever.

-> **Note:** As of now, it's not possible to assign objects as Do Not Protect.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "polaris_sla_domain" "bronze" {
  name = "bronze"
}

# Create a tag rule for AWS EC2 instances.
resource "polaris_tag_rule" "aws_bronze" {
  name        = "aws-bronze"
  object_type = "AWS_EC2_INSTANCE"
  tag_key     = "backup"
  tag_value   = "true"
}

# Create a tag rule for Azure VM instances.
resource "polaris_tag_rule" "azure_bronze" {
  name        = "azure-bronze"
  object_type = "AZURE_VIRTUAL_MACHINE"
  tag_key     = "backup"
  tag_value   = "true"
}

# Assign the tag rules to the bronze SLA domain.
resource "polaris_sla_domain_assignment" "bronze" {
  sla_domain_id = data.polaris_sla_domain.bronze.id

  object_ids = [
    polaris_tag_rule.aws_bronze.id,
    polaris_tag_rule.azure_bronze.id,
  ]
}
```
