# polaris_gcp_project (Resource)

The `polaris_gcp_project` resource adds a GCP project to RSC.

The `permissions` field of the each feature can be used with the 
`polaris_gcp_permissions` data source to notify RSC about permission updates
when the Terraform configuration is applied.

## Permission Groups
Following is a list of features and their applicable permission groups. These
are used when specifying the feature.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_ARCHIVAL`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.
  * `ENCRYPTION` - Represents the set of permissions required for encryption
    operation.

`CLOUD_NATIVE_PROTECTION`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.
  * `EXPORT_AND_RESTORE` - Represents the set of permissions required for export
    and restore operations.
  * `FILE_LEVEL_RECOVERY` - Represents the set of permissions required for
    file-level recovery operations.

`GCP_SHARED_VPC_HOST`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.

`EXOCOMPUTE`
  * `BASIC` - Represents the basic set of permissions required to onboard the
    feature.
  * `AUTOMATED_NETWORKING_SETUP` - Represents the set of permissions required
    for automated networking setup. When automated networking setup is enabled,
    RSC is responsible for creating and maintaining the networking resources for
    Exocompute. See the `polaris_gcp_exocompute` resource for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# With service account private key.
resource "google_service_account" "service_account" {
  account_id = "rubrik-service-account"
}

resource "google_service_account_key" "service_account" {
  service_account_id = google_service_account.service_account.name
}

resource "polaris_gcp_project" "project" {
  credentials    = google_service_account_key.service_account.private_key
  project        = "my-project"
  project_name   = "My Project"
  project_number = 123456789012
}

# With the RSC global service account key.
resource "polaris_gcp_project" "project" {
  project        = "my-project"
  project_name   = "My Project"
  project_number = 123456789012
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `project` (String) GCP project ID.
- `project_name` (String) GCP project name.
- `project_number` (String) GCP project number.

### Optional

- `cloud_native_protection` (Block List, Max: 1, Deprecated) Enable the Cloud Native Protection feature for the GCP project. **Deprecated:** use `feature` instead. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cloud_native_protection))
- `credentials` (String, Sensitive) Base64 encoded GCP service account private key or path to GCP service account key file.
- `delete_snapshots_on_destroy` (Boolean) Should snapshots be deleted when the resource is destroyed. Default value is `false`.
- `feature` (Block Set) RSC feature to enable for the GCP project. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--feature))
- `organization_name` (String) GCP organization name.
- `permissions_hash` (String, Deprecated) Signals that the permissions has been updated. **Deprecated:** use the `permissions` field of `feature` instead.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) RSC cloud account ID (UUID).

<a id="nestedblock--cloud_native_protection"></a>
### Nested Schema for `cloud_native_protection`

Optional:

- `status` (String) Status of the Cloud Native Protection feature.


<a id="nestedblock--feature"></a>
### Nested Schema for `feature`

Required:

- `name` (String) RSC feature name.
- `permission_groups` (Set of String) Permission groups for the RSC feature.

Optional:

- `permissions` (String) Permissions updated signal. When this field changes, the provider will notify RSC that the permissions for the feature has been updated. Use this field with the `polaris_gcp_permissions` data source.

Read-Only:

- `status` (String) Status of the feature.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = polaris_gcp_project.project
  id = "2689a6f0-41a5-4d7a-ba7f-ee591bb43e4a"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
% terraform import polaris_gcp_project.project 2689a6f0-41a5-4d7a-ba7f-ee591bb43e4a
```
