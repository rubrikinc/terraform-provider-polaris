# polaris_azure_custom_tags (Resource)

The `polaris_azure_custom_tags` resource manages RSC custom Azure tags. Simplify
your cloud resource management by assigning custom tags for easy identification.
These custom tags will be used on all existing and future Azure subscriptions in
your cloud account.

-> **Note:** The newly updated custom tags will be applied to all existing and
   new resources, while the previously applied tags will remain unchanged.

~> **Warning:** When using multiple `polaris_azure_custom_tags` resources in the
   same RSC account, there is a risk of a race condition when the resources are
   destroyed. This can result in custom tags remaining in RSC even after all
   `polaris_azure_custom_tags` resources have been destroyed. The race condition
   can be avoided by either managing all custom tags using a single
   `polaris_azure_custom_tags` resource or by using the `depends_on` field to
   ensure that the resources are destroyed in a serial fashion.

~> **Warning:** The `override_resource_tags` field refers to a single global
   value in RSC. So multiple `polaris_azure_custom_tags` resources with
   different values for the `override_resource_tags` field will result in a
   perpetual diff.
