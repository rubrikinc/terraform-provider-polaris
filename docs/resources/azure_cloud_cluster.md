# polaris_azure_cloud_cluster (Resource)

The `polaris_azure_cloud_cluster` resource creates an Azure cloud cluster using RSC.

This resource creates a Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM) cluster with elastic storage
in Azure using the specified configuration. The cluster will be deployed with the specified
number of nodes, instance types, and network configuration.

~> **Note:** This resource creates actual Azure infrastructure. Destroying the
   resource will attempt to clean up the created resources, but manual cleanup
   may be required.

~> **Note:** The Azure subscription must be onboarded to RSC with the Server and Apps
   feature enabled before creating a cloud cluster.

~> **Note:** Cloud Cluster Removal is not supported via terraform yet. The cluster
   will be removed from state and you must remove the cluster through the RSC UI.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an Azure cloud cluster using RSC
