  The polaris_azure_private_container_registry resource enables the private
  container registry (PCR) feature for the RSC customer account. This disables the
  standard Rubrik container registry.
  ~> Note: Even though the polaris_azure_private_container_registry resource
  ID is an RSC cloud account ID, there can only be a single PCR per RSC
  customer account.
  Exocompute Image Bundles
  The following GraphQL query can be used to retrieve information about the image
  bundles used by RSC for exocompute:
  
  query ExotaskImageBundle {
    exotaskImageBundle {
      bundleImages {
        name
        sha
        tag
      }
      bundleVersion
      eksVersion
      repoUrl
    }
  }
  
  The repoUrl field holds the URL to the RSC container registry from where the
  RSC images can be pulled.
  The following GraphQL mutation can be used to set the approved bundle version
  for the RSC customer account:
  
  mutation SetBundleApprovalStatus($input: SetBundleApprovalStatusInput!) {
    setBundleApprovalStatus(input: $input)
  }
  
  The input is an object with the following structure:
  
  {
    "input": {
      "approvalStatus": "ACCEPTED",
      "bundleVersion": "1.164",
  	"bundleMetadata": {
        "eksVersion": "1.29"
      }
    }
  }
  
  Where approvalStatus can be either ACCEPTED or REJECTED. bundleVersion
  is the the bundle version being approved or rejected. eksVersion is the
  version of the customer's EKS cluster.
