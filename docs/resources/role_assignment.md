  ~> Warning: When using multiple polaris_role_assignment resources to

# polaris_role_assignment (Resource)

The `polaris_role_assignment` resource is used to assign roles to a user or SSO
group in RSC.

~> **Warning:** When using multiple `polaris_role_assignment` resources to
   assign roles to the same user or SSO group, there is a risk for a race
   condition when the resources are destroyed. This can result in RSC roles
   still being assigned to the user or SSO group. The race condition can be
   avoided by either assigning all roles to the user using a single
   `polaris_role_assignment` resource or by using the `depends_on` field to make
   sure that the resources are destroyed in a serial fashion.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "polaris_role" "compliance_auditor" {
  name = "Compliance Auditor Role"
}

data "polaris_user" "compliance_auditor" {
  email = "auditor@example.org"
}

# Assign custom compliance auditor role to user.
resource "polaris_role_assignment" "compliance_auditor" {
  user_id = data.polaris_user.compliance_auditor.id

  role_ids = [
    data.polaris_role.compliance_auditor.id,
  ]
}

data "polaris_sso_group" "compliance_auditors" {
  name = "ComplianceAuditors"
}

# Assign role to SSO users using an SSO group.
resource "polaris_role_assignment" "compliance_auditor" {
  sso_group_id = data.polaris_sso_group.compliance_auditors.id

  role_ids = [
    data.polaris_role.compliance_auditor.id,
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `role_id` (String, Deprecated) Role ID (UUID). **Deprecated:** use `role_ids` instead.
- `role_ids` (Set of String) Role IDs (UUID).
- `sso_group_id` (String) SSO group ID. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `user_email` (String, Deprecated) User email address. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. **Deprecated:** use `user_id` with the `polaris_user` data source instead.
- `user_id` (String) User ID. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) User ID.
