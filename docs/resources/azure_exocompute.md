  The polaris_azure_exocompute resource creates an RSC Exocompute configuration.
  There are 2 types of Exocompute configurations:
   1. Host - When a host configuration is created, RSC will automatically deploy the necessary resources     in the specified Azure region to run the Exocompute service. A host configuration can be used by both     the host cloud account and application cloud accounts mapped to the host account.
   2. Application - An application configuration is created by mapping the application cloud account to a     host cloud account. The application cloud account will leverage the Exocompute resources deployed for     the host configuration.
  Since there are 2 types of Exocompute configurations, there are 2 ways to create a polaris_azure_exocompute resource:
   1. Using the cloud_account_id, region, subnet and pod_overlay_network_cidr fields. This creates a     host configuration.
   2. Using the cloud_account_id and host_cloud_account_id fields. This creates an application     configuration.
  ~> Note: A host configuration can be created without specifying the pod_overlay_network_cidr field,    this is discouraged and should only be done for backwards compatibility reasons.

# polaris_azure_exocompute (Resource)

The `polaris_azure_exocompute` resource creates an RSC Exocompute configuration.

There are 2 types of Exocompute configurations:
 1. *Host* - When a host configuration is created, RSC will automatically deploy the necessary resources     in the specified Azure region to run the Exocompute service. A host configuration can be used by both     the host cloud account and application cloud accounts mapped to the host account.
 2. *Application* - An application configuration is created by mapping the application cloud account to a     host cloud account. The application cloud account will leverage the Exocompute resources deployed for     the host configuration.

Since there are 2 types of Exocompute configurations, there are 2 ways to create a `polaris_azure_exocompute` resource:
 1. Using the `cloud_account_id`, `region`, `subnet` and `pod_overlay_network_cidr` fields. This creates a     host configuration.
 2. Using the `cloud_account_id` and `host_cloud_account_id` fields. This creates an application     configuration.

~> **Note:** A host configuration can be created without specifying the `pod_overlay_network_cidr` field,    this is discouraged and should only be done for backwards compatibility reasons.

-> **Note:** Using both host and application Exocompute configurations is sometimes referred to as shared    Exocompute.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Host configuration.
resource "polaris_azure_exocompute" "host_exocompute" {
  cloud_account_id         = polaris_azure_subscription.host_subscription.id
  pod_overlay_network_cidr = "10.244.0.0/16"
  region                   = "eastus2"
  subnet                   = "/subscriptions/65774f88-da6a-11eb-bc8f-e798f8b54eba/resourceGroups/test/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/test/subnets/default"
}

# Application configuration.
resource "polaris_azure_exocompute" "app_exocompute" {
  cloud_account_id      = polaris_azure_subscription.app_subscription.id
  host_cloud_account_id = polaris_azure_subscription.host_subscription.id
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `cloud_account_id` (String) RSC cloud account ID. This is the ID of the `polaris_azure_subscription` resource for which the Exocompute service runs. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `host_cloud_account_id` (String) RSC cloud account ID of the shared exocompute host account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `pod_overlay_network_cidr` (String) The CIDR range assigned to pods when launching Exocompute with the CNI overlay network plugin mode. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `region` (String) Azure region to run the exocompute service in. Should be specified in the standard Azure style, e.g. `eastus`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `subnet` (String) Azure subnet ID of the cluster subnet corresponding to the Exocompute configuration. This subnet will be used to allocate IP addresses to the nodes of the cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `subscription_id` (String, Deprecated) RSC cloud account ID. This is the ID of the `polaris_azure_subscription` resource for which the Exocompute service runs. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. **Deprecated:** use `cloud_account_id` instead.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Exocompute configuration ID.
